ApofAll Clarification

Is ApofAll a Newtonian?

No â€” itâ€™s a new class of telescope.

Many might assume ApofAll is simply a variation of a Newtonian â€” perhaps a Newtonian with a convex lens added near the focus.
But thatâ€™s not the case.

ðŸ”¸ Fundamental Differences

1. Diverging Geometry After the Secondary

In a Newtonian, light from the secondary mirror travels directly to the focal point at the focuser.
In ApofAll, the light diverges after the secondary and requires a carefully placed positive lens to reach focus.

This makes the lens essential, not optional â€” unlike a Barlow or coma corrector.

2. A Radically Smaller Secondary Mirror

Because the light cone doesnâ€™t need to expand fully before the lens, the secondary mirror can be extremely small â€” even 5 mm â€” without causing vignetting.

This dramatically reduces central obstruction, boosting contrast and sharpness.
In a Newtonian, this is simply not possible.

3. Focal Ratio and Field of View Are Preserved

Unlike systems that slow down the telescope (e.g., Barlows or relay optics), ApofAll retains the native focal ratio of the primary.

A 150/750 telescope stays fast and wide-field â€” ideal for both DSO and planetary observing.

4. Not a Jones-Bird, Not a Catadioptric, Not a Corrected Newtonian

The goal isnâ€™t to shorten the tube, correct spherical aberration, or fix coma.

ApofAll is designed to:

Reduce central obstruction

Keep the system fast and lightweight

Add minimal chromatic aberration

Boost contrast and brightness â€” especially in small reflectors

ðŸš€ A New Optical Branch

ApofAll is a hybrid optical system â€” not a Newtonian with accessories.
It belongs to the family of innovations like Maksutov-Newtonians or Schmidt-Newtonians â€”
but with a simpler, unique light path.

Its closest relatives may not exist â€” it may start an entirely new design branch.

âœ¨ ApofAll Is NOT:

A curved secondary system

A catadioptric

An off-axis or asymmetric telescope

A $17,500 observatory-class relic

Or an idea from 200-year-old books



---

It is a fast, compact, low-obstruction system â€” designed for affordable, high-contrast deep-sky and planetary viewing.

A telescope for everyone, not just specialists.
