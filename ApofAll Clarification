Is ApofAll a Newtonian?

No — it’s a new class of telescope.

Many may assume ApofAll is simply a variation of a Newtonian reflector — perhaps just a Newtonian with a convex lens added near the focus. But this is not the case.



ApofAll is not a Newtonian. It is a new class of optical configuration with the following fundamental differences:

1. Diverging Geometry After the Secondary

In a Newtonian, light from the secondary travels directly to the focal point at the focuser. In ApofAll, the light is intentionally diverging after the secondary mirror, and will not reach focus without a carefully placed positive lens.



This makes the lens essential, not optional — unlike a Barlow or coma corrector.

2. The Secondary Mirror Can Be Radically Smaller

Since the light cone doesn’t need to reach full width before the lens, the secondary can be extremely small — even 5 mm — without vignetting.



This dramatically reduces central obstruction, increasing contrast and sharpness. In a Newtonian, this would be impossible.

3. It Preserves Focal Ratio and Field of View

Unlike optical systems that slow down the telescope (e.g., Barlows or relay lenses), ApofAll preserves the native focal ratio of the primary mirror.



A 150/750 telescope remains fast and wide-field — even with the added lens. That means it retains both its deep-sky and planetary capabilities.

4. It Is Not a Jones-Bird, Not a Catadioptric, and Not a Coma-Corrected Newtonian

The goal is not shortening, not spherical correction, and not coma fixing.



ApofAll is designed to:

- Reduce central obstruction

- Keep the telescope fast and compact

- Add only minimal chromatic error

- Improve contrast and brightness, especially in small reflectors

So:

ApofAll is a hybrid optical system, not a Newtonian with accessories.

It belongs in the family of:

- New optical classes, like Maksutov-Newtonians or Schmidt-Newtonians

But with a simpler structure and a novel light path.



Its closest relatives may not exist — because it creates a new branch in the design tree.



ApofAll:

- Has no curved secondary mirror

- Is not catadioptric

- Is not off-axis or asymmetric

- Is not a $17,500 observatory telescope

- And is not from ancient books



It is a new, fast, compact, low-obstruction telescope for modern, affordable use — optimized for deep sky and high-contrast viewing.

Its goal is mass accessibility, not complexity.
