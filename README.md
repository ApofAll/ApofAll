# ApofAll – A Low-Obstruction Newtonian Telescope System

“ApofAll is a new telescope optical design proposed by Sasan Shirali Zadeh to reduce central obstruction and improve contrast.”

ApofAll originates from the Newtonian family, but diverges significantly in optical geometry, component roles, and light path behavior. It replaces the standard Newtonian configuration with a hybrid converging lens system, allowing for drastically reduced central obstruction and a fundamentally different imaging profile.

Because of these essential changes, ApofAll represents a new class of telescope design, not just a modification.

Invented by **Sasan Shirali Zadeh**, this open design gives classic Newtonians planetary performance approaching that of apochromatic refractors, without changing the telescope's focal ratio.
