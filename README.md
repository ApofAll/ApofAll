# ApofAll ‚Äì A Low-Obstruction Newtonian Telescope System

**ApofAll** is a simple optical modification for Newtonian telescopes that allows amateur telescope makers to dramatically reduce the central obstruction, improve image contrast, and maintain wide field of view ‚Äî all using a small secondary mirror and a single relay lens.

Invented by **Sasan Shirali Zadeh**, this open design gives classic Newtonians planetary performance approaching that of apochromatic refractors, without changing the telescope's focal ratio.
